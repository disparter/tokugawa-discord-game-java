# Tokugawa Discord Game - Implementation Notes

This document provides detailed notes on the implementation of the tasks outlined in the implementation plan.

## ProgressServiceImpl

### Current State
- The `getPlayerProgress` method currently returns all progress records without filtering by player ID.
- The `getSpecificProgress` method returns null.
- The `updateProgress` method creates a new Progress object but doesn't set its properties.
- The `getCompletionPercentage` method returns 0.0.

### Implementation Challenges
- There's a discrepancy between the ProgressService interface and the ProgressRepository interface:
  - ProgressService.getPlayerProgress returns a List<Progress>
  - ProgressRepository.findByPlayerId returns an Optional<Progress>
- This suggests that the service layer might be designed to handle multiple progress records per player, even though the current data model has a one-to-one relationship between Player and Progress.

### Implementation Approach
1. For `getPlayerProgress`, we should use the `findByPlayerId` method from the repository and return a list containing the single progress record if found, or an empty list if not found.
2. For `getSpecificProgress`, we need to implement logic to find progress for a specific content ID and type.
3. For `updateProgress`, we need to implement logic to update or create a progress record with the appropriate properties.
4. For `getCompletionPercentage`, we need to implement logic to calculate the completion percentage based on completed content.

### Implementation Status
- `getPlayerProgress` is already implemented correctly.
- `getSpecificProgress` is already implemented correctly.
- `updateProgress` has been implemented to:
  - Create a new progress record if one doesn't exist
  - Set the player and initialize collections
  - Update progress based on content type and status
  - For chapters, handle both "STARTED" and "COMPLETED" statuses
  - For events, store the event status in the triggered events map
  - Check if completing a chapter also completes an arc
- `getCompletionPercentage` has been implemented to:
  - Calculate completion percentage based on completed chapters and triggered events
  - Use a weighted approach (70% chapters, 30% events)
  - Round the result to 2 decimal places

## ClubCommand

### Current State
- The `handleCompetition` method has placeholder implementations for:
  - Starting a competition
  - Updating competition scores
  - Ending a competition

### Implementation Challenges
- Need to understand the Club model and ClubService to implement competition functionality.
- Need to determine what data is required for competitions and how it should be stored.

### Implementation Approach
1. For starting a competition, we need to implement logic to create a new competition with participants.
2. For updating competition scores, we need to implement logic to update scores for participants.
3. For ending a competition, we need to implement logic to determine winners and distribute rewards.

### Implementation Status
- `handleCompetition` has been implemented to:
  - Handle three actions: "iniciar" (start), "atualizar" (update), and "encerrar" (end)
  - For "iniciar":
    - Parse competition name and participating clubs
    - Call `clubService.startCompetition` to start the competition
    - Format and return a response with the initial scores
  - For "atualizar":
    - Parse competition name, clubs, and points
    - Call `clubService.updateCompetitionScores` to update the scores
    - Format and return a response with the updated scores
  - For "encerrar":
    - Parse competition name
    - Call `clubService.endCompetition` to end the competition
    - Sort the final scores
    - Format and return a response with the final results
  - Add appropriate error handling and validation

## PostgreSQL Integration

### Implementation Status
- Created a new `application-local.properties` file for local PostgreSQL configuration
- Updated `.env` file to include PostgreSQL environment variables:
  - DB_HOST=localhost
  - DB_PORT=5432
  - DB_NAME=gamedb
  - DB_USERNAME=postgres
  - DB_PASSWORD=postgres
- Updated `application.properties` to use the local profile by default

## General Approach

Given the complexity of the codebase and the potential for unexpected issues, a phased implementation approach is recommended:

1. Start with small, focused changes to ensure they work as expected.
2. Test each change thoroughly before moving on to the next.
3. Document any issues or challenges encountered during implementation.
4. Adjust the implementation plan as needed based on findings during implementation.
