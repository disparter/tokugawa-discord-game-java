# Tokugawa Discord Game Migration Plan: Python to Java

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating the Tokugawa Discord Game from Python to Java 21 with Spring Boot 3+. The game is a social Discord game where players can interact with NPCs, participate in events, and progress through a story mode. The current implementation uses Python with Discord.py, and the new implementation will use Java with Discord4J for Discord integration and a REST API for the story mode.

## Project Structure

### Current Python Structure
- **src/bot.py**: Main entry point for the Discord bot
- **src/cogs/**: Discord command modules
- **src/core/**: Core game logic and services
- **src/story_mode/**: Story mode implementation
- **src/events/**: Event handling
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions

### Proposed Java Structure
- **src/main/java/com/tokugawa/discord/**
  - **TokugawaDiscordApplication.java**: Main Spring Boot application
  - **bot/**: Discord bot implementation using Discord4J
    - **commands/**: Discord command implementations
    - **listeners/**: Discord event listeners
  - **api/**: REST API for story mode
    - **controllers/**: API endpoints
    - **dtos/**: Data transfer objects
  - **core/**: Core game logic
    - **models/**: Domain models
    - **services/**: Business logic services
    - **repositories/**: Data access
  - **config/**: Configuration classes
  - **utils/**: Utility classes

## Migration Steps

### 1. Project Setup (Week 1)
- [x] Create a new Spring Boot project with Java 21
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Configure build system (Maven/Gradle)
- [ ] Add necessary dependencies:
  - Spring Boot Starter Web
  - Spring Boot Starter Data JPA
  - Discord4J
  - Lombok
  - Spring Boot DevTools
  - H2 Database (for development)
  - PostgreSQL (for production)
  - Spring Boot Test

### 2. Domain Model Migration (Week 2)
- [ ] Analyze existing Python data models
- [ ] Create equivalent Java entity classes:
  - Player
  - Chapter
  - Event
  - NPC
  - Relationship
  - Club
  - Item
  - Inventory
  - Progress
- [ ] Implement repositories for data access
- [ ] Set up database schema and migrations

### 3. Core Services Implementation (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement service interfaces based on Python abstractions:
  - PlayerService
  - NarrativeService
  - EventService
  - RelationshipService
  - ClubService
  - ProgressService
- [ ] Implement business logic in service implementations
- [ ] Set up dependency injection

### 4. Discord4J Integration (Week 4)
- [ ] Set up Discord4J client
- [ ] Implement command handlers for:
  - Registration
  - Player status
  - Economy
  - Events
  - Activities
  - NPC interactions
  - Companion interactions
- [ ] Implement event listeners
- [ ] Set up Discord interaction handling

### 5. Story Mode API Development (Week 5)
- [ ] Design RESTful API endpoints for story mode:
  - GET /api/story/chapters: Get available chapters
  - GET /api/story/chapters/{id}: Get chapter details
  - POST /api/story/chapters/{id}/start: Start a chapter
  - POST /api/story/chapters/{id}/choices: Make a choice in a chapter
  - GET /api/story/progress: Get story progress
  - GET /api/story/events: Get available events
  - POST /api/story/events/{id}/trigger: Trigger an event
- [ ] Implement controllers for API endpoints
- [ ] Create DTOs for request/response data
- [ ] Implement service layer for API
- [ ] Set up API documentation with Swagger

### 6. Integration and Testing (Week 6)
- [ ] Integrate Discord4J with story mode API
- [ ] Implement unit tests for:
  - Services
  - Repositories
  - Controllers
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Perform load testing

### 7. Data Migration (Week 7)
- [ ] Design data migration strategy
- [ ] Create scripts to export data from Python application
- [ ] Create scripts to import data into Java application
- [ ] Test data migration
- [ ] Create backup and rollback plans

### 8. Deployment (Week 8)
- [ ] Set up Docker containerization
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up database for production
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor production deployment

## Technical Considerations

### Discord4J vs Discord.py
- Discord.py uses a command-based approach with cogs
- Discord4J uses a reactive programming model
- Need to adapt command handling and event listening patterns

### Spring Boot API Design
- RESTful API design for story mode
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Error handling
- Logging and monitoring

### Data Persistence
- JPA entities for domain models
- Spring Data repositories for data access
- Transaction management
- Database migrations with Flyway or Liquibase

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services and repositories
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for Discord commands
- Load testing for API performance

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Discord API Changes
- **Mitigation**: Keep Discord4J updated, monitor Discord API announcements

### Risk: Data Loss During Migration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup strategy, thorough testing of migration scripts

### Risk: Performance Issues
- **Mitigation**: Load testing, performance monitoring, optimization

### Risk: User Experience Disruption
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, clear communication with users, fallback to Python version if needed

## Conclusion
This migration plan outlines a comprehensive approach to migrating the Tokugawa Discord Game from Python to Java with Spring Boot and Discord4J. By following this plan, we can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining the game's functionality and improving its architecture.
