#### EventServiceImpl
- Replace hardcoded romance routes with database or configuration loading
- Implement proper inventory management for event rewards

#### PlayerServiceImpl
- Replace hardcoded player data with database loading

#### ReputationServiceImpl
- Implement faction-specific reputation updates

### Commands

#### ClubCommand

## Python Application

### Story Mode

#### seasonal_events.py
- Replace placeholder implementation for player skill or choice-based outcomes
- Implement proper application of seasonal event effects to gameplay

#### companions.py
- Implement proper application of companion effects to gameplay

#### npc_relationship.py
- Replace placeholder date implementation with actual date tracking

## General Recommendations

1. **Database Integration**: Many services use placeholder implementations that should be replaced with actual database queries.
2. **Configuration Loading**: Replace hardcoded values with configuration loading from files or database.
3. **Feature Completion**: Complete unimplemented features, particularly in the club competition system.
4. **Effect Application**: Implement proper systems for applying various effects (consequences, seasonal events, companion effects) to gameplay.
5. **Testing**: Ensure all implemented features have appropriate test coverage.

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize the items in this list based on their impact on gameplay and user experience.
2. Create specific tasks for each item in the project management system.
3. Assign resources and timelines for completing these tasks.
4. Implement a testing strategy to ensure that new implementations maintain system stability.
