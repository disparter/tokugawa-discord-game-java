# Tokugawa Discord Game - Implementation Notes

This document provides detailed notes on the implementation of the tasks outlined in the implementation plan.

## ProgressServiceImpl

### Current State
- The `getPlayerProgress` method currently returns all progress records without filtering by player ID.
- The `getSpecificProgress` method returns null.
- The `updateProgress` method creates a new Progress object but doesn't set its properties.
- The `getCompletionPercentage` method returns 0.0.

### Implementation Challenges
- There's a discrepancy between the ProgressService interface and the ProgressRepository interface:
  - ProgressService.getPlayerProgress returns a List<Progress>
  - ProgressRepository.findByPlayerId returns an Optional<Progress>
- This suggests that the service layer might be designed to handle multiple progress records per player, even though the current data model has a one-to-one relationship between Player and Progress.

### Implementation Approach
1. For `getPlayerProgress`, we should use the `findByPlayerId` method from the repository and return a list containing the single progress record if found, or an empty list if not found.
2. For `getSpecificProgress`, we need to implement logic to find progress for a specific content ID and type.
3. For `updateProgress`, we need to implement logic to update or create a progress record with the appropriate properties.
4. For `getCompletionPercentage`, we need to implement logic to calculate the completion percentage based on completed content.

## ClubCommand

### Current State
- The `handleCompetition` method has placeholder implementations for:
  - Starting a competition
  - Updating competition scores
  - Ending a competition

### Implementation Challenges
- Need to understand the Club model and ClubService to implement competition functionality.
- Need to determine what data is required for competitions and how it should be stored.

### Implementation Approach
1. For starting a competition, we need to implement logic to create a new competition with participants.
2. For updating competition scores, we need to implement logic to update scores for participants.
3. For ending a competition, we need to implement logic to determine winners and distribute rewards.

## General Approach

Given the complexity of the codebase and the potential for unexpected issues, a phased implementation approach is recommended:

1. Start with small, focused changes to ensure they work as expected.
2. Test each change thoroughly before moving on to the next.
3. Document any issues or challenges encountered during implementation.
4. Adjust the implementation plan as needed based on findings during implementation.
