- **Database Optimization**: Optimize database queries for performance.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use Spring's asynchronous capabilities for long-running operations.

## Conclusion

The Java implementation of the Tokugawa Discord Game has made significant progress in establishing the basic structure and framework, but there is still substantial work to be done to fully migrate all features from the Python implementation. By focusing on the key components outlined in this document and following the recommended implementation priorities, the migration can maintain the core experience that players enjoy while improving scalability, maintainability, and performance.
